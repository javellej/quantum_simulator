# Quantum Circuit Simulator

This project demonstrates the simlutaion of quantum circuit with a universal set of gates on a limited number of 1-qubit registers.

## Dependencies


## Build the project

Simply type 'make' at the root of the project.
Two binaries will be produced:
   - 'build/unit' that runs the unit tests
   - 'build/run_circuit' that runs the main circuit

Compilation in debug mode (with symbols and optimisation turned off) is done with 'make debug' and compilation in release mode (with optimisations and LTO) with 'make release'.
